# Enhanced Vouch System with User Tracking

## ðŸŽ¯ Overview

Your vouch system now properly integrates with the `vouches` table to track which user vouched for which issue, preventing duplicate vouches and providing better analytics.

## ðŸ”§ What's Changed

### Database Functions

1. **`vouch_issue(issue_id, user_id)`** - Enhanced vouch function
   - âœ… Tracks which user vouched for which issue
   - âœ… Prevents duplicate vouches (user can only vouch once per issue)
   - âœ… Works with Firebase authentication (extracts user from JWT)
   - âœ… Updates both `vouches` table and `issues.vouch_priority`
   - âœ… Bypasses RLS restrictions safely

2. **`check_user_vouch(issue_id, user_id)`** - Check vouch status
   - âœ… Returns whether a specific user has vouched for an issue
   - âœ… Returns total vouch count for the issue
   - âœ… Works with Firebase authentication

### Backend API Updates

**POST `/api/issues/{id}/vouch`** - Enhanced vouching
- âœ… Extracts user ID from Firebase JWT token
- âœ… Calls `vouch_issue()` function with user tracking
- âœ… Returns proper error for duplicate vouches (409 status)
- âœ… Fallback to legacy mode if function unavailable

**GET `/api/issues/{id}/vouch`** - Enhanced vouch check
- âœ… Uses `check_user_vouch()` function for accurate data
- âœ… Returns `user_vouched` status for authenticated users
- âœ… Shows actual vouch count from `vouches` table

## ðŸš€ Features

### Duplicate Prevention
```json
// If user already vouched, returns:
{
  "error": "User has already vouched for this issue",
  "already_vouched": true
}
```

### User Tracking
```json
// Successful vouch response:
{
  "message": "Issue vouched successfully",
  "issue_id": 19,
  "vouch_count": 3,
  "vouch_priority": 3,
  "user_vouched": true,
  "user_id": 123,
  "source": "database"
}
```

### Firebase Integration
- âœ… Automatically detects Firebase users from JWT tokens
- âœ… Maps Firebase UID to your users table
- âœ… Works seamlessly with your authentication system

## ðŸ§ª Testing

### Test Vouching
```bash
# Authenticated user vouch
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/issues/19/vouch \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer your-firebase-token"

# Check vouch status
curl -X GET http://localhost:5000/api/issues/19/vouch \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer your-firebase-token"
```

### Expected Responses

**First vouch (success):**
```json
{
  "message": "Issue vouched successfully",
  "issue_id": 19,
  "vouch_count": 1,
  "user_vouched": true
}
```

**Duplicate vouch (prevented):**
```json
{
  "error": "User has already vouched for this issue",
  "already_vouched": true
}
```

**Vouch status check:**
```json
{
  "issue_id": 19,
  "title": "Street Light Issue",
  "vouch_count": 1,
  "user_vouched": true,
  "user_id": 123
}
```

## ðŸ“Š Analytics Queries

### Get users who vouched for an issue:
```sql
SELECT u.civic_id, u.mobile_number, v.created_at
FROM vouches v
JOIN users u ON v.user_id = u.id
WHERE v.issue_id = 19
ORDER BY v.created_at;
```

### Get issues vouched by a user:
```sql
SELECT i.title, i.category, v.created_at as vouched_at
FROM vouches v
JOIN issues i ON v.issue_id = i.id
WHERE v.user_id = 123
ORDER BY v.created_at DESC;
```

### Top issues by vouch count:
```sql
SELECT i.title, COUNT(v.id) as vouch_count
FROM issues i
LEFT JOIN vouches v ON i.id = v.issue_id
GROUP BY i.id, i.title
ORDER BY vouch_count DESC;
```

## ðŸ”„ Migration Steps

1. **Run the SQL script:**
   ```sql
   -- Execute vouch_fix_quick.sql in Supabase SQL editor
   ```

2. **Restart your Flask server:**
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

3. **Test the functionality:**
   - Try vouching with authentication
   - Try vouching without authentication  
   - Try duplicate vouch (should be prevented)
   - Check vouch status
